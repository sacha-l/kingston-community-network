## About
The Kingston Community Network is an initiative conceived by [Bitswift](https://www.bitswift.io/), aiming to bring free Wi-Fi connectivity across downtown and uptown Kingston, Ontario (Canada) while providing a platform for businesses to advertise their products to connecting passerbys. 

This way, KCN aims to be a catalyst for:

- Free internet access without the need to rely on a single internet provider
-  Driving local engagement with local businesses and their daily specials

Bitswift Inc. is a technology company based in Kingston, ON, in operation since 2014 servicing clients for their IT infrastructure and connectivity needs. Over the years it has grown into a multifaceted company spearheading the use of cutting edge technologies for Kingston businesses and homes such as mesh networks, utility for digital assets and basic IT infrastructure needs. 

## Why this repo ?
First and foremost, this repo is a place for people interested in this initiative to keep track of its rollout. It's more importantly a place for developers to propose changes or contribute to what's already here. This can range from modifications in the website's copy, to creating the backend for handling business onboarding. Just make a pull request. :wink:

### Website 
Built using a fantastic template released under the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) originally by [Cruip](https://cruip.com/), the website is a place for people to learn about the KCN initiative, sign up for updates and onboard new business owners. 

### Todo List
This is an actively maintained todo list for new features. It will soon be ported over to Issues:
- **Basic Splash page template**: a splash page with place for participating businesses to have their logo and website URL
- **Sign up**: a place for businesses to sign up to receive next steps for onboard process
- **Dashboard**: for businesses who login
- ... And a lot more but this is good for now :smiley:

### License
The platform being built here is completely open source (MIT License) for others to implement in their towns or city neighborhoods.

## Project phases
### Pilot 
With a few local businesses on board and a splash page for users to connect with, KCN has what it needs to test its potential. These businesses are all in the service industry, either hotels, restaurants and cafes. In this phase, we'll make sure to process all the feedback we get before moving onto the next phase. :ramen:

### Onboarding new businesses
We'll be using our website to onboard new businesses who want to participate in the network. This may require installing access points for those who don't have a mesh-friendly infrastructure already in place. But these are inexpensive. And we'll make sure all the relevant information is communicated during this phase. :telephone_receiver:

### Target advertising
Here we plan to build out a dashboard for businesses to use KCN to customize their promotional activity. Think of it as like having coupons or writing out daily specials on a sidewalk chalkboard. With this, business owners can broadcast their promotions to a specified coverage area on KCN. :dart:

### Access to Token Rewards
As a final feature to KCN, we envision giving businesses the option to reward their customers with either general purpose KCN tokens or business specific tokens. These would be secured as digital assets on a public blockchain. For example, a customer receives KCN tokens for referring a local business to a friend. Those tokens can be spent on whichever business connected to KCN accepts them. Tokens can be created and managed by businesses themselves. [Bitswift](https://www.bitswift.io/) provides good guidance for using this world. :moneybag:
